# Next generation phenotyping of inherited retinal diseases using multimodal imaging with Eye2Gene

Dataset DOI: [10.5061/dryad.pc866t21g](10.5061/dryad.pc866t21g)

## Description of the data and file structure

Synthetic dataset containing 100 Fundus Auto Fluorescence (FAF) image from each of 10 genes which includes (ABCA4, BEST1, EFEMP1, EYS, MYO7A, PRPH2, RPGR, RS1, TIMP3 and USH2A). These images were generated by the SynthEye algorithm (https://www.ophthalmologyscience.org/article/S2666-9145(22)00147-6/fulltext).
### Files and variables

#### File: syntheye100\_synthetic\_faf.zip

**Description:** Each foldercorresponds to a gene name (ABCA4, BEST1, EFEMP1, EYS, MYO7A, PRPH2, RPGR, RS1, TIMP3 and USH2A).  Each folder contains 100 synthetic Fundus Auto Fluorescence images generated by the SynthEye algorithm (https://www.ophthalmologyscience.org/article/S2666-9145(22)00147-6/fulltext).
## Code/software

No software is needed to view the data.  The images were generated by SynthEye (https://www.ophthalmologyscience.org/article/S2666-9145(22)00147-6/fulltext).  The code base for SynthEye can be found here: https://github.com/pontikos-lab/syntheye


## Human subjects data

This data is synthetic data. It is therefore not identifiable.
